                    Hello! I am Gregory. I have just started down the path of software engineering. Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Engineer for 
                    the Army Software Factory. Technologies that I currently use are ReactJS, MySQL, and Java Spring. Before embarking 
                    on the journey of software engineering, I was a Cyber Network Defender for the US Army and stationed at Fort Hood, Tx.
